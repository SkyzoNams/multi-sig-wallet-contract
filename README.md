## Project

A design and implement a secure multi-signature wallet Solidity smart contract 


## The assessment

- Define the number of signatories required to execute a transaction (e.g. 2 out of 3).
- Define the list of signatories and their addresses.
- Implement the functionality to add/remove signatures.
- Implement the functionality to execute a transaction after the required number of signatures have been obtained.
- Implement the functionality to cancel a transaction before it has been executed.
- Implementing a way to recover the wallet in case of loss of private keys.
- Access control for actions that can be taken by signatories (e.g. add/remove signatories, execute/cancel transactions).

## Deployment

The smart contract is deployed on the Sepolia testnet -> https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x65Cf1dAc8D2467A7b53D818F39c1Fc53483fb169
